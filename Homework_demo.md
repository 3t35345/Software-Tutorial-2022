## Deadline
The deadline for homework demonstration would be 7 days after your tutorial session. (i.e. If you attend S01 on 3/10, you need to do your homework on or before 10/10)

## Submission
You score is marked if you have demonstrated the homework tasks to the seniors. However, you are advised to create a private repository using this [Public Template](https://github.com/UST-Robotics-Team/SoftwareTutorialHW) and store your source code there and invite us `UST-Robotics-Team` as the collaborator. You only need to upload `main.c`, `tutorial2_hw.c`, `tutorial3_pwm.c` and other files you have changed. In that case, we can evaluate your coding style. More instructions are given in the `README.md`.
